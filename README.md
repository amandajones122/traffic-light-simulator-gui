# traffic-light-simulator-gui
A GUI that simulates linear traffic flow w/ interactive features
_____________________________________________________________________
Description

This java project is a graphic user interface (GUI) where three vehicles and three traffic lights are generated upon startup. The vehicles travel at consistent, randomly generated speeds. The time elapsed and the vehicle speeds in mph are displed using (x,y) coordinates. Vehicles stop when the timed traffic lights turn red and resume traveling when they turn green again. The user interface features buttons to start, pause/continue or stop the simulation. There are also buttons to add additional vehicles and traffic lights to the simulation. 

This project was created for an upper level undergraduate computer science course.
